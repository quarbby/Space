Overview: This is a space card game to educate students and children on different elements of space launchers. Currently, this game skeleton has the card deck for space launchers, and we will be hoping to expand it to other space objects, e.g. planets, space suits and so forth.

Objective: To get rid of all the cards on hand.

Game Play: 
1. Each player is dealt 7 cards. 
2. At each turn, you can play a card whose categorical value beats the current value at hand or a special card. 

----------------

Current Status: 
- Player vs Computer & Player vs Player (for up to four players) are completed
- Player can select different decks to play the game in

Good to have: 
- Allow players to play against themselves over the network, using WiFi or 3G Internet Connection

How to create an Expansion Pack for this game: 

1. Create a csv .txt file with the following five fields: name,height,diameter,mass,payload
2. Get images of the data in 48x48 .png format. Name them the same way as it was named in the .txt file except without the spaces or capital letters. For example, if the space launcher was named Long March 4 in the .txt file, which will be displayed on the card, the image file should be named longmarch4.
3. Send me a message on Twitter @quarbby and I'll add it into the game for you!
